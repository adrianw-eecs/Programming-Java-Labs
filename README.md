# Programming-Java-Labs
These Labs were done as part of courses at York University.
Data Structures I have studied and programed in basic forms.
-Array Queue
-Binary Search Tree
-Array List
-Linked List

The 2 Maze Solver's were part of an assignment. 
The first one is able to traverse an Maze in the form of an array and find the end point using reccursion to display the shortest path.
The second Maze solver performs a similar maze however it does not get stuck in a infinite loop, as it hold an array of elements it has visited.
